                        The first lesson on ID began with the basics, I learnt the basic 3 core ID elements. HTML, CSS, and JS(Javascript).
                        I mostly learnt the bare basics of HTML as we learnt about Key elements, elements, elements being inside of elements,
                        how to use images in HTML, lists, headings, tables, iframes, adn even getting a group activity about how to make a
                        good website. And had to make a recipe book as practice.

                    <section>  
                        Week 2 was all about the basic methods to do CSS, here I learnt how to use styles to do basic asthetics to my websites
                        like how to change font colours, how to do background colours, the 3 colour types, basic, RGB, and RG. Ive also learnt 
                        the link element with href, Id's, Classes, Typography, and box models.

                      Week 3 was by far what I considered to be the most important. Here we learnt 
                      about forms and the input function. As well as nested elements, the descendant 
                      ,grouping and cascade selector rules, the important! feature. More about CSS
                      regarding styles. And most importantly, relative, absolute, Z-index and flexboxes.
                      As well as the power of a wrieframe.

                        Responsive images, Github and Adobe XD was all part of week 4's info. I learnt about 
                        the information on how to link my Github repositories to VS code for a smoother and
                        more easier way to code. Adobe XD was also a really powerful tool to learn and use 
                        for my wrieframes to build my website. The first image showcases randomly showcased
                        images when page is refreshed

                    <section>  
                        Week 5 was an asynchronus session, and most possibly the most important asynchronus 
                        session ever. Diving into the 3rd of the 3 core programmes, Javascript. Here I learnt
                        the basics of Javascript and how different and more complicated it is compared to CSS and HTML.
                        Too much javascript was learnt that week. All I can say is, its very similar to C#'s coding
                        scheme, like woah look at this Javascript.

                    <section>  
                        I learnt how to make a navigation bar for my Assignment 1 website, and even developed a dropdown
                        page out of pure HTML and CSS (without the use of javascript). I may not keep the dropdown page tho,
                        since the design doesnt really merge well with my final visio of the project.
                        I also learnt about OOP, the var, let and const identifiers as well as how to implement a for loop.
                        Not to mention the DOM tree and the way to access elements method.

                        There was not really many new things I learnt this week, with the only new thing being how to make events and add event listeners.
                        The main thing that I did was my Assignment 1, which due date is this week, so I'm mostly working for that. The mobile version 
                        tougher than I thought but it should be working fine soon.

                        JQuery and API, JQuery is a simpler more efficient way to find elements, update their content, and to simplify event handling, 
                        making javascript easier to understand which is a HUGE help for me. The API lesson was also useful, learning about AJAX, XML and JSON files 
                        delivering and updating the API, how to retrieve/ link to it using Fetch() and PSI. 
                        Also in regards to my comments with Assignment 1. I have learnt that padding and margin will kill your website if you try to port that
                        over to mobile version, so made a little oopsie there.

                        Week 9 was another Asynchronus lesson, and to be honest its probably the one I spent the least time on since I was busy with a few other module 
                        projects. Here I basically only touched on the required lesson, bootstrap. Another extension that makes coding websites alot more easier, mainly
                        focusing on the aspects of HTML. Charts was also a lesson I briefly ran through but didnt really put into practice.

                        The final assignment has just been delivered to us and so has one of the final lessons. RestDb and NoSQL. RestDB, being the main API website
                        data storage that I would use to store my data and link it to my already developing assignment 2. NoSQL (or not only SQL) is the definition 
                        of a database that needs large scale data, the definition of RestDB. <br>
                        <br>

                        Was nothing new to learn in lesson for week 13, however I did go and research on my own on how to store data inside the website itself, since
                        my website for assignment 2 would be utilising a log in and sign up form with use of RestDB, this week I found out about the more intricate 
                        way of the fetch() method as well as a method that I felt more comfortable in, local and session storage. other than that, all I did was the
                        Assignment as well as other assignments from other modules.

                        Lottie animations was by far one of the most exciting lessons that I studied on my own, lottie is a fun website where you can add 
                        small GIF like animations to your website. I immediately saw this as an amazing way to spice up and make the website look more smooth And
                        appealing to users. So I immediately put that use into developing icons for the website and I do not regret my decision one bit. Out of all the
                        lessons (the asynchronus ones at least), I found this lesson to be the most enjoyable.

                  Week 15 BONUS
                    <section>  
                        Week 15 was mostly spent on just doing assignments. It was a very tough time for this week and the one after that, 4 assignments and 3 tests in 2 weeks,
                        3 of the assignments which were due this week and both tests the week after that. So its really difficult to find time for this assignment this week.
                        However, I did find time to FINALLY implement the full link to the API's, using the POST and GET functions as well as local storage and JQuery to help.
                        So I deem this week to be a relatively successful week

                        The due date was coming up and I was still a little worried about my website, my group memeber was doing fine but I still felt like out webstie was not
                        as refined as some others already were in my class. This week I added the lottie animations to the pages that needed them, as well as made the BIG 
                        decision of having 2 of the same pages with different uses, One for if the user has'nt logged in yet, and one for when he has. This will make our job
                        alot more easier as now we are able to put our main working code linked to the API without having to use Display: none and Display: block as much as before.

                  Conclusion
                    <section>  
                        When I came into ID I was not very interested in the subject. Website making was just not a image of my interests. However after the end of Assignment 2,
                        I realised that although it can be VERY tedious at times (JAVASCRIPT IS PAIN), and sometimes you cannot find the solution that something doesnt work 
                        and then have to spend like an hour combing through your code to find the 1 letter you missed in the "" (trust me it happened). Other than that, HTML was 
                        alright, CSS too. JQuery was a great tool to use, as well as lottie animations. I've learnt ALOT about websites in just 1 semester. And to be honest, I 
                        can't wait for next semester, as "stack overflow" is somewhat related to ID.
